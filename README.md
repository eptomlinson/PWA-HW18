# Warm Tundra Budget Tracker!!!

When life gives you lemons, make sure to count how many lemons you just got! Hi, I'm Troy McLure! You may remember me from such apps as Game of Games, the board game API app, or Dinner and a Movie, the app that randomly selects a restaurant and movie to end your squabbles with your SO over what to do on date night.

Introducing: WARM TUNDRA BUDGET TRACKER!!!

By going to the URL https://warm-tundra-83212.herokuapp.com/ you can start tracking your expenses in real time. Simply enter a name for the transaction, and the dollar amount, then click whether this dollar amount is being added or subtracted from your budget. Don't worry, the computer will do the math for you AND keep track of literally EVERYTHING you enter (using MongoDB Atlas)! It really is THAT easy!

Even when you're driving through a tunnel in the middle of nowhere (put your phone down, you're driving!), you can still cache the data on the front end of the app for when you reconnect to civilization.

Disclaimer: Warm Tundra assumes no liability for you choosing to share your budgetary data on our app.
